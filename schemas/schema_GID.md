# Game Idea Document

> **When responding, remove these blockquoted instructions and return only the filled-in sections.**

> **Hard constraints — these color every answer below:**
> - Solo dev budget: ~365 hours/year
> - Deploy on Windows (Steam) and/or iOS (iPhone/tablet). No consoles.
> - No photorealistic art. No side-scrollers. 3D preferred.
> - Multiplayer only if local (zero maintenance cost post-release).
> - Be blunt. I'd rather hear "this idea doesn't work because X" than a polished document for a doomed project.

## Genre(s)

> 1–2 genres.

## Reference Games & Inspirations

> 2–5 games I'm drawing from. For each: the game name, and the ONE specific thing I'm stealing from it. No vague "it has good vibes."

## Pillars

> 3–5 fundamental backbones. Short and ruthless.
> Each pillar must describe a player-facing behavior or system rule, not a feeling.
> I should be able to point at any feature and say which pillar it serves — or cut the feature.
> Bad: "Engaging combat." Good: "Every enemy has a telegraphed pattern the player can learn to parry."

## Scope Limitations

> List 2–3 features your target audience would EXPECT this game to have, that you're choosing to cut anyway. For each, name what you gain from the cut (time, focus, simplicity). Cutting things nobody expected doesn't count.

## Core Loop

> Primary loop in arrow format (e.g. Explore → Gather → Craft → Upgrade → Explore).
> Answer all three:
> 1. How does this loop generate replayability without large amounts of handcrafted content?
> 2. What is the MINIMUM content needed to ship this loop? (Be concrete — e.g. "8 enemy types, 1 biome, 20 items")
> 3. If procedural generation is used, list exactly which variables are being remixed and their value ranges. "Procedural" is not a plan.

## Session Design

> Fill in all four:
> - Target session length (per run):
> - Target total player engagement time:
> - What makes the player stop AND want to come back?
> - Why does this session length match the monetization model?

---

## Elevator Pitch

> 1–3 sentences. Include the visual/aesthetic hook — if I post a screenshot or gif of this game, why would someone stop scrolling?

## The Big But

> "My game is like ___, but ___."

## Target Audience

> Who is this for? People who like ___. Optionally specify age range, or say "for kids" if applicable.

## Monetization Model

> One line: premium, free+IAP, etc. This constrains design heavily, especially across Steam + iOS.

---

## Platform Considerations

> How does the game work on both a desktop with mouse/keyboard AND a phone with touch? Account for screen real estate, processing power, and input differences. If it doesn't work on both, say so.

## Assets

> What do I need to create or purchase? Be frugal, avoid hand-crafting.
> Name the SINGLE most expensive asset category and how I'll keep it under control.
> Where can AI generation help? Give a specific example, not "AI can help with art."

## Tools & Workflow

> What existing tools or workflows should I evaluate BEFORE building anything custom?
> Only suggest custom tooling if it solves a problem no existing tool handles, and estimate its build cost.
> Unity/Blender compatibility matters if they aren't standalone.

## First Playable Milestone

> What is the minimum slice that proves the core loop is fun?
> Define it concretely — what does the player DO in this build, and what's missing that I'll add later?
> Estimate hours for this milestone only.

## Phase Breakdown

> Break the full project into phases. For each phase:
> - What it includes
> - T-shirt size estimate (S/M/L/XL where S≈20h, M≈50h, L≈100h, XL≈200h)
> - Flag which phase is most likely to balloon and why

## Risks & Mitigations

> Up to 3. Each risk paired inline with its mitigation and what I'd cut first if time runs short. No orphaned risks.
