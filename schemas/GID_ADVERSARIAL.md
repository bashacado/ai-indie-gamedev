# GID Adversarial Review

> **Role:** You are a skeptical producer reviewing a solo dev's Game Idea Document. Your job is to find the holes BEFORE they cost months of work. Be constructive but never polite at the expense of honesty.

## Contradiction Scan
<!-- Check for internal contradictions. Specifically test these pairs:
- Pillars vs. Core Loop: Does the loop actually exercise every pillar? Are any pillars decorative?
- Scope Limitations vs. Core Loop: Did we cut something the loop secretly depends on?
- Session Design vs. Monetization: Does the session structure fight the business model?
- Target Audience vs. Platform: Is the audience actually on the target platforms?
- Elevator Pitch vs. Pillars: Does the pitch promise something the pillars don't support?
List each contradiction found, or state "None found" per pair. -->

## The "Who Cares?" Test
<!-- Assume I post a 10-second gif of this game on Twitter/Reddit.
- What EXACTLY is visually happening in that gif?
- Would someone who has never heard of this game stop scrolling? Why or why not?
- Name 1–2 existing games whose gifs consistently go viral in this genre. What do they show that this game also shows (or doesn't)? -->

## Scope Reality Check
<!-- Given the phase breakdown and 365h/year budget:
- Does the total add up to under 365h for a v1 release? If not, what gets cut?
- Which phase estimate is most likely to be wildly optimistic? Why?
- Is the "first playable milestone" actually the right slice to prove fun, or is it testing the wrong thing? -->

## The Graveyard Question
<!-- Name the SINGLE closest failed competitor — a game with a similar concept that flopped or went unnoticed.
- Why did it fail?
- What structural difference (a specific mechanic, market condition, or scope decision) prevents the same fate here?
- Then name 1–2 more failed or ignored games in the space.
- If you can't find failures, that's a red flag — either the niche is untested or you're not looking hard enough. Say so. -->

## Market Saturation Probe
<!-- Search Steam and iOS for the 5 most recent releases in this genre from the last 12 months. How many reviews/ratings does each have?
- If the median is low, the audience may not be there.
- If the median is high, name the top performer and what makes this game mechanically distinct from it. Not aesthetically — mechanically. -->

## Hidden Risk Audit
<!-- Are the risks listed in the GID actually the real risks, or did the generation pass identify comfortable risks while ignoring the scary ones?
Name at least one risk the GID didn't list. Explain why it was likely avoided and why it matters. -->

## Kill Criteria
<!-- Define 2–3 concrete, measurable conditions under which I should abandon or pivot this idea.
E.g. "If after 60 hours the core loop prototype isn't fun without art, pivot."
These must be specific enough that I can't talk myself out of them. -->

## Verdict
<!-- One of:
- **GREEN:** Viable as scoped. Proceed to first playable.
- **YELLOW:** Viable with changes. List the changes required before proceeding.
- **RED:** Fundamental issues. Do not proceed without rethinking [specific section].

Justify in 2–3 sentences. -->

## Stress Tests
<!-- Answer both:
1. Assume I have only 200 hours, not 365. What collapses first, and what does a 200-hour version of this game look like?
2. If the 200-hour version feels like a different game, the scope is unstable. Explain why.
3. What is the single most likely reason this project gets abandoned halfway through? Be psychologically honest — not just "scope creep." -->
